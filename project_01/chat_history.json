In water, light travels at approximately 225,000 kilometers per second or about 139,770 miles per second. The exact value can vary depending on various factors, such as the temperature and composition of the water. This difference in speed is due to the interaction of light with the particles and molecules present in the medium, which affects its propagation.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "ai", "example": false}}]
